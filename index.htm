        <p>
          Every candidate for election promises to be responsive and accountable to the citizens whose votes 
          they ask for.  We're putting that commitment to the test by asking candidates a series of 
          <a href="http://elections.raisethehammer.org/election/1#questions">questions</a>
          about their campaigns, their priorities and what they believe is best for Hamilton.  Here's how
          they stack up against each other in terms of how responsive they've been to these important questions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Please note:</strong> Questions are posed to candidates by email, and their responses are entered
          manually by RTH staff.  There may be a delay of several hours between when a candidate answers a question, 
          and when this report is updated thus, a difference in responsiveness of just one question should not be 
          considered significant.
