This is another, more complex demonstration of how to access the Raise the Hammer Elections API (http://elections.raisethehammer.org/apidoc).

The three most important files are:

api.php: this allows us to bypass Javascript's cross-domain request policy by doing the cross-domain request with PHP instead.  It also performs some simple caching of API requests.

index.htm: the page where things are displayed.

public/application.js: this is where all of the interesting stuff happens and where the work gets done.

Why PHP and Javascript?
-----------------------

My first choice for web development would normally be Ruby, but I wanted this to be accessible to lots of people, so I chose PHP as the server-side language instead.  However, although everything in this project could have been accomplished with just PHP (or any server-side language), I don't like using PHP much any more, so I did as much as possible in Javascript.

Setup
-----

If you want to get this running, just copy the secret_key.php.template file to one called just secret_key.php.  Edit it to put in your own key.  That's it, although in a production environment you're going to want to ensure you have the right permission on /cache, which ought to be readable and writable by the user that PHP runs as.
